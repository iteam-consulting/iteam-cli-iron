# iTEAM Consulting CLI: Iron
Iron is used to scaffold, build, test, run and deploy iTEAM Consulting frontend web projects.

## Getting Started
Iron is packaged by NPM.  Please ensure you have installed Node v7.2.x and npm v5.4.x installed before continuing.
### Installation
```
npm install iteam-cli-iron -g
```
### Usage
Once installed, you will have access to the ```iron``` tool from your command line.
#### Create a project
```
iron new <project>
```
This creates a new folder in your current directory, and initializes the Iron project with default settings. Once the initialization is complete, use ```cd <project>``` to enter the project directory.
